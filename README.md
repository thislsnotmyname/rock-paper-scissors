# rock-paper-scissors
This project's purpose is to recreate the game (Rock, Paper, Scissors)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors] in JavaScript.
At the time of writing, the game is played through browser prompt boxes with the result of each round and game displayed in the browser console. In a later update, a GUI will be implemented.

This project was created as an exercise for (The Odin Project)[https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors].
